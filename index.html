  We have seen several benefits of good posture.<br>To take advantage of these benefits, you should make good
  posture, a part of your everyday life.

  <p style="margin-top:25px;">One way to do this is to imagine that a string (coming from the top of your head) is pulling you gently up towards the ceiling.

  With consistent effort,you can improve your posture. You might just improve your overall quality of life too.</p>
